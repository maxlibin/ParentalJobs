### Web:
Clone the project to your local folder:

The project is structured into 3 parts

```
| packages - frontend
| pacakges - backend
```
Since we are using yarn workspace, you can install the web project with:

```
yarn install
```
in the root folder, this will install node_modules into root folder and alias to `packages/*` so that you don't have to go into each folder to install, and start by

```
yarn dev
```

Open your browser with port 3000, `http://localhost:3000`
